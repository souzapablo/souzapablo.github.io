>I've been strugling to find a drive for upgrading my portfolio. Since I began working as a developer, I couldn't find any purpose to focus on developing an app. **But now I have it**.

## The problem I want to solve 

My wife works as an embroiderer and struggles to manage her finances, especially pricing her products fairly — she often underprices them. To help her, I’ll develop an app to organize her business:

- Register all the products she buys, including their suppliers.
- List the customers and their orders.
- Track the status of orders easily.
- Calculate fair pricing based on materials and time spent (this will likely be customizable).

## A new approach to personal projects

In the past, I would dive straight into coding without much planning. I would create the solution, set up the projects and folders, and went all in. 

While projects started quickly, they often fizzled out because I didn’t have a clear roadmap.

For this project, I’m taking a professional approach. Talking about sprints might be too much, but I’ll plan a backlog, define detailed tasks, and organize them in a Kanban board.

## Join me on this journey

I’m excited to share updates as I build this app! If you’ve tackled similar challenges in your projects, I’d love to hear your tips and experiences. Let’s learn and grow together!
