I am a developer with nearly `three years of professional experience`, having contributed to projects in diverse industries such as insurance, finance, education, and gaming. 

Recently, I completed my studies and earned a `bachelor's degree in Computer Science`.

While my primary expertise lies in `backend development`, I am `naturally curious` and enjoy exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies to expand my skill set and enhance my work.

Beyond coding, I am passionate about `reading and gaming` — two activities that fuel my creativity and keep me inspired. Before entering the tech world, I pursued a degree in Portuguese Literature and conducted academic research in Literary Studies. 

I have a particular love for fantasy books, such as The Kingkiller Chronicle series, but I also enjoy the classics such as the intricate, thought-provoking prose of José Saramago, with his endless paragraphs.

Let’s not keep it too long. I hope you enjoy my content and feel free to keep in touch if you wish!
